### 1. **Streamlit Interface**
This module provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the generator.

#### **File: `main.py`**

##### **Key Features**
- Accepts a URL input via a text box.
- Initiates the process of job extraction and email generation upon submission.
- Displays the generated email in markdown format.

##### **Workflow**
1. Accepts a URL from the user.
2. Scrapes the content using `WebBaseLoader`.
3. Cleans the text using the `clean_text` utility.
4. Extracts jobs using the `Chain` class.
5. Matches skills with portfolio links using the `Portfolio` class.
6. Generates a cold email using the `Chain` class.

##### **Example**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    chain = Chain()
    portfolio = Portfolio()
    st.set_page_config(layout="wide", page_title="Cold Email Generator", page_icon="ðŸ“§")
    create_streamlit_app(chain, portfolio, clean_text)
```

### 2. **Portfolio Matching**
This module manages a portfolio database and matches job skills with relevant links.

#### **File: `portfolio.py`**

##### **Key Features**
- Loads a portfolio from a CSV file.
- Stores portfolio data in a ChromaDB vector store for efficient querying.
- Queries for relevant links based on extracted job skills.

##### **Workflow**
1. Loads portfolio data into a vector store.
2. Matches job skills with portfolio links using a similarity query.
3. Returns the top relevant links.

##### **Example**
```python
portfolio = Portfolio()
portfolio.load_portfolio()
links = portfolio.query_links(["Python", "Machine Learning"])
print(links)
```

### 3. **AI-Driven Job Extraction and Email Generation**
This module handles interaction with the language model for job extraction and email writing.

#### **File: `chain.py`**

##### **Key Features**
- Extracts job postings from cleaned web content using structured prompts.
- Generates customized cold emails with portfolio links.

##### **Workflow**
1. **Job Extraction**:
   - Processes cleaned text with structured prompts.
   - Outputs job details in JSON format.
2. **Cold Email Generation**:
   - Creates personalized emails based on job descriptions and portfolio links.

##### **Example**
```python
chain = Chain()
jobs = chain.extract_jobs(cleaned_text)
email = chain.write_mail(jobs[0], ["http://portfolio-link1.com"])
print(email)
```

---

### 4. **Text Cleaning Utility**
This module preprocesses raw web content for extraction.

#### **File: `utility.py`**

##### **Key Features**
- Removes HTML tags, URLs, special characters, and redundant spaces.
- Prepares clean, readable text for job extraction.

##### **Example**
```python
raw_text = "<div>Python Developer</div> Visit us at https://example.com!"
cleaned_text = clean_text(raw_text)
print(cleaned_text)
```
